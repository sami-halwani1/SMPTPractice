# CPSC471_SMTP

Lab 3:	SMTP	Lab
By the end of this lab, you will have acquired a better understanding of SMTP protocol. You will also
gain experience in implementing a standard protocol using Python.
Your task is to develop a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. Your client will need to
connect to a mail server, dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, and send an email
message to the mail server. Python provides a module, called smtplib, which has built in methods to send
mail using SMTP protocol. However, we will not be using this module in this lab, because it hide the
details of SMTP and socket programming.
